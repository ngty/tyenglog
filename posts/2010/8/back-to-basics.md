Enough is enough, i seriously don't think i'm built to use any online blogging engines.
Simply because i'm built to prefer typing in my terminal, using vim, and prefer playing
with terminal-interfaced stuff, instead of so called idiot-proof online tools ... i
guess i'm probably more idiot than idiots.

Moreover, blogspot is blocked by the great wall of china (at least this is what i've
encountered in shanghai), and though i can continue to access it via some customized
proxy settings, it is terribly slow, slow & slow. In fact, i find it amazing that i am
able to bear with it for so long ...

Anyway, enough is enough, here i am, back to basics, typing my blog in vim, on the engine
side, i'm using the git-based blogging engine [shinmun](http://github.com/georgi/shinmun),
and deploying it at [heroku](http://tyenglog.heroku.com/) ...

Ha, it cannot be any easier than what i have now ... what a wonderful world !!
